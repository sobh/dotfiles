# Description:  Start NeoVim with the different configuration, using the
#               $NVIM_APPNAME environment variable.
# Usage:        Create a 'symlink' to this script named by the configuration
#               directory you'd like to use. Then, just start nvim using that
#               symlink.
#

# The distro name is the basename of the script. If symlinked, then it would be
# the name of the symlink.
export NVIM_APPNAME=$(basename $0)
# Start nvim: Tada
nvim $*
