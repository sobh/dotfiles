# Description:  Volume control script for Unix systems.
#
# Note:
#   - For this script to work properly, the default card must be set correctly.
#   Assuming we have 2 cards with index 0 and 1 respectively and wish to simply
#   change the default card to index 1, would lead to the following
#   configuration in `/etc/asound.conf` or the user-specific `~/.asoundrc` to
#   change both the playback and the mixer control card.
#
#   ```~/.asoundrc
#     defaults.pcm.card 1
#     defaults.ctl.card 1
#   ```
